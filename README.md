# Siemens_test
To start the program, run the .but file, then three containers will be created which are linked together. The first container will contain the PostgreSQL database, the second Grafana, and the third the sin(x) value generator which fills the database. To view the resulting graph, click on the link http://localhost:4000, and then enter your login and password (default is admin). After that go to the dashboards tab, where you can see the graph (to tell the truth the only thing I failed to do - the dashboard needs to be created automatically in the container - in this version every time you start grafana, you need to create the dashboard again and connect the corresponding PostgreSQL dataset to it). Data for connecting to the dashboard host : my-postgres:5432, user: postgres, password: mysecretpassword, dbname: postgres.
