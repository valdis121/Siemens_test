# Siemens_test
To start the program, run the .but file, then three containers will be created which are united in one network. The first container will contain the PostgreSQL database, the second Grafana, and the third the sin(x) value generator which fills the database. To view the resulting graph, click on the link http://localhost:4000, and then enter your login and password (default is admin). After that go to the dashboards tab, where you can see the graph (To tell the truth, the only thing I could not do is configure automatic importing dashboard into the container from the local machine, now I have to create a data source and dashboard manually every time you start the container). Data to connect the database as a data source host : my-postgres:5432, user: postgres, password: mysecretpassword, dbname: postgres.
